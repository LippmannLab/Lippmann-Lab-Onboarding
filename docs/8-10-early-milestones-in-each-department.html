<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.10</span> Early Milestones in Each Department</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of variability in the department graduation requirements. Here’s a short summary of some of the milestones that occur up to the qualifying exam and what is required for each milestone for the departments that are commonly represented in the Lippmann Lab. Graduate school documents for forming your thesis committee, scheduling your qualifying exam, and preparing your dissertation/defense can be found <a href="https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/academics/forms_timeline.php">here</a>. Make sure you are aware of your department’s specific requirements for each milestone.</p>
<div id="chbe" class="section level3" number="8.10.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.1</span> Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CHBE)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Departmental Exam:</strong> This exam typically occurs in late August/early September. Students are expected to prepare a 10 page written report and a 20 minute oral presentation. Students should focus on how the principles of chemical engineering applies to their research and should demonstrate the progress they have made on their research projects – the latter point is the most important, while the former point will typically be raised by the faculty during the Q&amp;A. One retake is held in December if students do not pass the first exam.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualifying Exam:</strong> Chemical Engineering students are expected to take their qualifying exam by the end of their 5th semester at Vanderbilt (although most students take it sometime during their 2nd year). Students should prepare a written document and an oral presentation on their dissertation proposal. Written documents should be given to the students’ committees at least 2 weeks before the oral component of the exam. This exam can be taken a maximum of 2 times.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Committee:</strong> A minimum of 4 people including Ethan, 2 CHBE faculty members, and an additional faculty member from outside the department. Students should meet with their committee at least once a year after passing their qualifying exam.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="bme" class="section level3" number="8.10.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.2</span> Biomedical Engineering (BME)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mentoring Committee Meetings:</strong> Prior to forming our thesis committee, BME graduate students are randomly assigned a committee of 3 BME professors (including Ethan) around November of their first year. BME students are expected to meet with their mentoring committee every 6 months until they form their thesis committee. These meetings are typically just 30 minutes with 15 minutes spent presenting to your committee and 15 minutes for questions. The template for mentoring committee meeting presentations can be found <a href="">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualifying Exam:</strong> Lippmann lab BME students typically take their qualifying exam during their 3rd year at Vanderbilt (although there is some flexibility). Students should prepare a written document and an oral presentation on their dissertation proposal. Written documents should be given to the students’ committees at least 2 weeks before the oral component of the exam.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Committee:</strong> A minimum of 5 people including Ethan, 2 BME faculty (with at least one having a primary appointment in BME), at least one member from VUMC, and an additional member from any department. BME students are expected to meet with their committee at least every 6 months after passing their qualifying exam.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="ims" class="section level3" number="8.10.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.3</span> Interdisciplinary Materials Science Program (IMS)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Preliminary Exam:</strong> This exam will be taken before the end of the third semester at Vanderbilt, ideally after the majority of required coursework is completed. The main purpose of this exam is to confirm that you have the potential to make a successful PhD student and that you have an adequate understanding of the foundations of materials science from all previous courses. Since our lab is mostly concerned with biomaterials, this exam will be focused on a short presentation of all the research you have accomplished (10-15 min) and an “area paper” (4-10p) which will need to be submitted to your committee at least one week before your exam. You will be responsible for forming a preliminary exam committee which consists of five faculty members (including Ethan) that are from at least three different departments. This may be the same committee that you choose to move forward with for your qualifying exam, but it does not have to be. If you fail your first examination, your committee may decide to allow you to sit for a second exam or suggest that you complete the additional research work required to earn a master’s degree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualifying Exam:</strong> The IMS qualifying same is similar to quals for other departments. Its main purpose is to determine that your proposed research will be worthy of attaining your PhD. It must be completed within four years of entering Vanderbilt and at least six months before defending. Similar to the Preliminary Exam, there is both a written and oral portion although each are more lengthy. The written proposal should be sent to your committee at least two weeks before your exam and is a formal, detailed justification of your proposed hypothesis future research direction, supported by the work that you have completed so far. You will then give a 30-minute talk to your committee, followed by a period of oral examination.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Committee:</strong> The composition of your thesis committee for your qualifying exam and PhD defense may be the same as for your preliminary exam. Your thesis committee should comprise of your 2 thesis advisers and 3 other faculty members. Three faculty must be members of the Graduate Faculty and at least 3 affiliated with the Materials Program. For more detailed information see “Expectations for IMS preliminary and qualifying exams” document that you received during orientation.</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="igp" class="section level3" number="8.10.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.4</span> Interdisciplinary Graduate Program (IGP) and Quantitative and Chemical Biology (QCB): Neuroscience Track</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Qualifying Exam:</strong> All neuroscience students take their qualifying exams at the end of the second year. The requirements typically include a written exam in the form of a Nature Neuroscience style review document. This review is expected to cover literature that supports the student’s disseration research topic and must be broadly related to their thesis. Alongside the review document, the student is expected to submit a specific aims page outlining their plan for the next few years of grad school (work on this begins as part of a grant writing course in the Spring). Neither documents can be reviewed by the PI and must be original work. Following submission of the written portion of the exam, students take an oral qualifier comprised of a 5 minute chalk talk followed by open question by the committee for up to 2 hours. This includes topics like general knowledge of neuroscience, experimental design and thesis project. Oral exams usually occur between June to August. The qualifying exam committee must comprise of three professors of the student’s choice and one department appointed committee chair.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Committee:</strong> The composition of the thesis committee may differ from that of the qualifying exam committee. These are typically professors with research backgrounds similar to the student’s thesis project. You are required to have 2 Neuroscience faculty members and 1 external faculty member on your committee. Committee meetings should typically occur atleast once a year until the final defense or more frequently as requested by the student or committee.</li>
