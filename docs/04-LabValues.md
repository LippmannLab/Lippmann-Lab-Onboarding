## Lab Philosophy


## Code of Conduct
The lab should be a fun and safe place for everyone to work. Any issues, personal or professional, that affect the lab environment or the well-being of any of its members should be brought to my attention *immediately.* I will do my best to promote a sense of camaraderie and accountability, but it is the responsibility of every individual to be good lab citizens.
