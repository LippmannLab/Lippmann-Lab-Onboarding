It should be kept as up-to-date as possible. The lab has a Slack, which we use more quick messaging. Request to be added to our lab’s listserv by emailing Alex Sorets. This is generally used for longer, lab-wide annoucements. 3 Calendars Finally, our lab has a Github account that we use for code versioning and internal sharing. 1.2 Becoming an effective researcher There is no set formula to facilitate a productive research career but based on Dr. Lippmann’s experiences and the graduate students he’s seen crash and burn, he expects that you will: Spend 40-60 hours a week in the lab environment. Do your work when it needs to be done. Preparation, preparation, preparation Be honest with your data - to Dr. Lippmann and yourself. Read, read, read. Stay current on the literature. Keep a personal library of the papers you read. Keep your lab notebook up-to-date. Attend campus seminars that are relevant to your research, and probably a few that you simply find interesting. Rely on the experience of others. If you want to build something: 1.3 Fellowships All lab members are expected to apply for external funding. For graduate students, this includes the NSF GRFP, NDSEG, NIH F31 fellowship, and AHA pre-doctoral fellowships. Dr. Lippmann can discuss other opportunities that arise, and he will be cognizant that certain students are not competitive for certain fellowships, but every student-earned fellowship provides more money that can be spent on supplies and equipment.
