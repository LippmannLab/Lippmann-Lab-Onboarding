## Lab Accounts

1. The lab has a [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwvn9S-4oeMmeHhzUS1nM0FNak0?usp=sharing) that we use for documentation and inventory. It should be kept as up-to-date as possible. 

2. The lab has a [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/lippmann-lab/shared_invite/zt-k04qrgk6-D795CQ2~bDwWv21w2ItPMQ), which we use more quick messaging. 

3. Request to be added to our lab's listserv by emailing [Alex Sorets](mailto:alexander.g.sorets@vanderbilt.edu). This is generally used for longer, lab-wide announcements. 

4. Our lab also has 3 calendars to schedule general lab events, book specific hoods, and to book time on our microscope. Request access to these calendars: [Lippmann Lab Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bXFkOWE3bjM3MTkxbzluYWVtbWw0NDd2bGtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ), [Lippmann Lab Microscope](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZjNkMXBkbmFwZzc0NWR2YmVmNXU0bGN1YjBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ), [Lippmann Lab 118 Small Hood](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=MGk3NGZpdm5ua2JyZjMyc2duNTE2aGMxOWdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). 

5. Send an email to the [Vanderbilt IT Department](mailto:dts.se.support@Vanderbilt.Edu) asking for access to our lab's shared network drive. Include your VU NetID in this email. 

6. Finally, our lab has a [Github](https://github.com/LippmannLab) that we use for code versioning and internal sharing. 

## Becoming an effective researcher

There is no set formula to facilitate a productive research career but based on Dr. Lippmann's experiences and the graduate students he's seen crash and burn, he expects that you will:

- Spend 40-60 hours a week in the lab environment. 

- Do your work when it needs to be done. 

- Preparation, preparation, preparation 

- Be honest with your data - to Dr. Lippmann and yourself. 

- Read, read, read. 

- Stay current on the literature. 

- Keep a personal library of the papers you read. 

- Keep your lab notebook up-to-date. 

- Attend campus seminars that are relevant to your research, and probably a few that you simply find interesting. 

- Rely on the experience of others. 

- If you want to build something:

## Fellowships

All lab members are expected to apply for external funding. For graduate students, this includes the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), NDSEG, [NIH F31 fellowship](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/f31), and AHA pre-doctoral fellowships. Dr. Lippmann can discuss other opportunities that arise, and he will be cognizant that certain students are not competitive for certain fellowships, but every student-earned fellowship provides more money that can be spent on supplies and equipment. Current and previous students have uploaded their applications to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j3YPUUUFINandBSU6xtTeN0iOQ3wscMg?usp=sharing) for internal sharing.
