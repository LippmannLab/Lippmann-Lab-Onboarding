<p>This section will contain tips on how to present scientific work. An entire chapter is dedicated to writing manuscripts.</p>
<div id="oralpres" class="section level3" number="6.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Creating an Oral Presentation</h3>
<p>All graduate students and postdocs will present a research update once a semester at the lab group meeting. Additionally, lab members may have the opportunity to speak at department retreats, seminars, and conferences.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Make sure you don’t put too much content on each slide.</strong> The goal is for your audience to listen to you as you speak and not spend the entire time trying to read your slide. Figures are preferable over text. Large or complicated figures should be broken down. You can use basic animations to make the information contained in the slides, but don’t get too cute with your use of animations. You can also split complicated topics into a couple slides. Animations or pointers can also help your audience know what you are discussing on each slide.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure your slide titles are descriptive and contain the main takeway.</strong> Don’t use slide titles that don’t add any information or is too technical.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Citations should be enough information for you audience to find the articles/websites.</strong> This is usually the fist author, journal title, and year at the minimum for articles. You should cite all figures that are not originally made by you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure your text is large enough to be seen from far way.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Figues should be fully explained.</strong> You should describe what the data points are, what the axes mean, etc. in addition to explaining the main takeway from the figure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remember that anything you put on your slide is fair game.</strong> The audience has the right to ask you questions on anything that you put on your slide. This is especially true for qualifying exams and dissertation defenses. Be careful putting in information or figures that you are not prepared to explain in detail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It’s usually a good idea to pause briefly before moving on to the next slide in order to see if anyone has any questions.</strong> You can also incorporate planned pauses into your presentations in order to make room for audience questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be aware of who your audience is when you are creating your presentations.</strong> The way that you present in a lab meeting might be different than how you present at a conference. Make sure you know who might be in your audience when you are putting it together so that you don’t get too technical and detailed or too broad and superficial. This includes knowing when you should define abbreviations. For example, you might not need to define iPSCs or BBB in lab meetings, but you should define it at a qualifying exam or at a conference.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you are using a pointer, make sure you practice using it before you present.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="4-5-practice.html#practice">Practice</a> your oral presentation with the lab!</strong> If you are presenting at a conference/meeting or for a department milestone, it is highly encouraged that you practice with the lab. Just send out an email or Slack message about availability, and senior students would be happy to watch a practice presentation.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="journalclub" class="section level4" number="6.3.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1.1</span> Journal Club Presentations</h4>
<p>The lab rotates who presents an article for our lab’s journal club, which is usually emailed out at the beginning of each semester. There are also other opportunities to present at other journal clubs on campus such as at the Alzheimer’s Disease Journal Club. In addition to the tips from the above section on oral presentations, here are some additional tips for presenting at journal clubs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Picking an article to present:</strong> You should choose a paper that has been published relatively recently. Ethan will typically assist younger students before their first presentation. These articles should be sent to lab at least a week prior to presenting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know background material about the chosen paper.</strong> You should have knowledge of the research and work that contributed to the paper you chose to present. You should provide enough information in the introduction for lab members who may not be familiar with the topics described in the paper. Simplify complex topics for non-experts to understand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Describe the research question and the importance/context of the research.</strong> This can also help organize your presentation as the authors draw conclusions to answer these research questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Break down figures and other complex information.</strong> The way data is presented in a paper is not necessarily the way it should be presented in an oral presentation. Break down figures into smaller, understandable chunks so that it’s not too overwhelming to your audience. Additionally, make sure you make the figures large enough for your audience to read. Be ready to discuss all the components of the figures. Try not to make your slides too text heavy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide information on uncommon techniques used in the paper.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be ready to discuss the paper in lab.</strong> Identify pros and cons about the techniques used and/or the conclusions drawn from the paper. What questions did you still have after reading the paper? This helps show an understanding of the paper, and what you learn from this practice can help with peer reviewing papers. Additionally, it can lead to better lab discussions about the paper.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be ready to discuss why you chose that paper.</strong> You can talk about how it relates to your work or techniques you are interested in using.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="creating-a-poster-presentation" class="section level3" number="6.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Creating a Poster Presentation</h3>
<p>Lab members may also present their work in poster at internal and external meetings and conferences.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Know who your audience is when creating your poster.</strong> This will help determine how much background information needs to be provided as well as what jargon you should use. Your poster should not be too technical and detailed if you are presenting to a broad conference, but it should also not be too broad or simplified if you are presenting at a field-specific conference.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your posters should contain at minimum:</strong> an introduction/background/significance section, at least one results/discussion/methods section, a conclusion/future directions section, an acknowledgments section, and a reference section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Figures and diagrams are preferable to text, but you should give enough information that your audience can understand your figures and the conclusions that are drawn from your results.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use bullet points with short sentences/phrases rather than paragraphs of text for easier reading.</strong> Make sure any text is concise and relevant. Use consistent formatting throughout the poster. Try to avoid redundancy and vague phrases. Make sure your results headings draw attention to the question you are answering and/or conclusions you are drawing from the results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure figures and text are legible from far away.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use blank space wisely.</strong> This empty space can help draw attention to important information. Scale and color can also demonstrate relative importance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practice how you are going to present your poster to your audience.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Senior students would be happy to look over posters and provide feedback.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Poster templates can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V1ykFkQy5sY_4hgSlZhh6y-axiy3mreH?usp=sharing">here</a>. You can download these templates and edit it for your own posters.</p></li>
