# Frequently Asked Questions
These are topics that are commonly asked about when new members join the lab. Additionally, feel free to ask senior lab members for more information or advice whenever you have questions. 

## Scheduling Vacations
Taking time off is necessary to avoid burn-out during graduate school. While iPSC culture requires daily maintenance, it is still possible to take vacations and rest. Short trips over the weekend do not need to be cleared with Ethan, but Ethan should be aware if you are planning on taking longer periods of time off. 

If you are asking another lab member to cover your work while you are out of lab, you should ask that lab member at least a week before you are gone (unless it's a personal health or family emergency). Before you leave you should provide the following information:

- How long you'll be out of lab

- What cells need their media changed each day you are gone and what media to use following this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e7WmtnTOwzWEQ0M4DY7jF22D8st5nZTYDcJ1Tv7Nfsg/edit?usp=sharing). 

- Where the cells are located

- Where media and other necessary reagents are located

- How to make more media if the lab mate is not used to maintaining the cell types

- How to operate devices (if needed)

- If you want more iPSCs when you come back and if you are leaving Matrigel plates

You should not:

- Ask your lab mate to run experiments for you while you are gone

- Maintain short term differentations (ex: BMECs) or common iPSCs (ex: CC3s) if you'll be gone for a week or more 

Typically, first year students will get Thanksgiving break off. More senior students will rotate who covers this holiday. The lab generally shuts down for the holidays in December/January, although a couple of lab members may stay behind for maintaining long-term cultures (like neurons or organoids) or animals. Holidays such as the 4th of July or Labor Day are usually treated as half days where many people usually choose to do their bare minimum work and take the rest of the day off. If lab meetings fall on the U.S. Election Day, Ethan will cancel those meetings in order to allow lab members to vote if they have not already.

It is up to you to make sure that you are getting the necessary work done in order to graduate on time. 

## Mental Health in Graduate School
Mental health is a major issue in graduate school. Many members of the lab use mental health resources available on campus including the [University Counseling Center (UCC)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/) and the [Vanderbilt Graduate Life Coach](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/current_students/gradlife.php). Our medical insurances provides free access to [psychiatry services](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/services/psychiatric-services/) although medication may still cost some money. Outside resources such as [PhD Balance](https://www.phdbalance.com/). Feel free to reach out to other members of the lab if you are having issues or need people to talk to! 

## Advice to Navigating Co-Mentorships 


## Registering for Courses in the YES Portal
Graduate students register for courses on the [Vanderbilt YES Portal](http://yes.vanderbilt.edu/). You can register for courses using the "Student Registration" tab. All graduate students are required to enroll in 9 credit hours every semester. 

- Enrolling in Classes: 
  - Search for the courses you are required to take/interested in taking
  - Click on the course and click the "Add to Cart" button at the bottom of the pop up screen. 
  - Move the to "In Cart" tab. 
  - Click the down arrow at the left side of the course. Click on "Enroll."
  - You can see how many courses/credit hours you are enrolled in for each semester by moving to the "Enrolled" tab. 

- Enrolling in Research Credit:
  - Search your home department in the search bar. 
  - If you have not passed your qualifying exam yet, select Ethan's course in the Non-Candidate Research offerings. If you have passed your qualifying exam, select Ethan's course in the Ph.D. Dissertation Research offerings. 
  - Enroll in the course using the instructions listed in the "Enrolling in Classes" bullet point. 
  - Move to the "Enrolled" tab. On the right side of the course, there is an edit button (looks like a pencil and paper). Click the edit button. 
  - Select the number of research credit hours you need to enroll in, and click the "Save" button. 
  - This needs to be done every semester even after you are done taking classes for Vanderbilt tuition purposes (Ph.D. students do not pay for tuition themselves). 

## Recommended Elective Courses
Graduate students are expected to take courses that are required by their specific department. Some training grants such as the T32 in Environmental Toxicology also have course requirements that appointees must take. The number of elective classes you can take varies by department, but here's a list of common elective courses that Lippmann Lab graduate students take to finish their course requirements:

- NURO 8345: Fundamentals of Neuroscience I (offered every Spring)

- NURO 8365: Neurobiology of Disease (offered every Spring)

## Core Facilities on Campus
There are a variety of equipment that graduate students and postdocs can use through [Vanderbilt University (VU)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/cores/cores-facilities.php) and the [Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)](https://www.vumc.org/oor/institutional-research-shared-resources-and-core-facilities). Common core facilities that the Lippmann Lab uses includes the VUMC Flow Cytometry Shared Resource, VUMC Translational Pathology Shared Resource, VU NMR Facility, VU Cell Imaging Shared Resource (CISR), and the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (VINSE). If you are interested in seeing what equipment the lab is trained to use, you can look at [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gsTkMHcHbQ4z3y_Iq0_OSRODjhGSvkoRmYmUvWKNb2M/edit?usp=sharing). You can also talk to Ethan about getting trained to use different facilities on campus. Students should have an iLabs account set up in order to use most core facilities. 

## Potential Vanderbilt Funding Sources
There is the potential to have travel, research, and your stipend funded from Vanderbilt sources other than Ethan's grants at Vanderbilt. This is a (non-comprehensive) list of potential funding sources open to Lippmann Lab trainees. 

### Graduate Student Council (GSC) Travel Grant
GSC offers up $500 [travel awards](https://studentorg.vanderbilt.edu/gsc/travel-funding-request/) for enrolled Vanderbilt graduate students. Graduate students are eligible for travel grants up to 3 times during their training. 

### Graduate Leadership Institute (GLI) Grants
GLI offers two types of funding opportunities: [GLI Dissertation Enhancement Grants](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/gli/deg/) and [GLI Professional Development and Training Grants](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/gli/pdt/). The Dissertation Enhancement Grants offers up to $2,000 for dissertation research expenses. All Ph.D. students in good academic standing are eligible to apply. The Professional Development and Training Grants offers up to $1,000 for professional development and training opportunities. This can include traveling to conferences.

### Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR) Vouchers
The [Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research](https://victr.vumc.org/) can be a source of funding to use core facility equipment on campus. Ethan will usually talk to you about applying for VICTR vouchers, and resources for filling out the application can be found in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xe3LeIbXhmq09adtJ0cnFZ08d9W6Qn29?usp=sharing). Note that especially motivated undergraduate students can also apply for vouchers. If you receive an updated biosketch from Ethan, please upload it to the folder. You can make a biosketch using the SciENcv section of [your My NCBI account](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/). 

### Training Grants
There are several NIH-funded training grants that can cover up to 2 years of your training. Lippmann lab members have been funded through the T32 Training Grant in Alzheimer's Disease and the T32 Training Grant in Environmental Toxicology. The activities required while funded by the training grants will vary but can include presenting at a seminar, participating in a journal club, or taking certain courses. Typically, Ethan will talk to you about training grant funding opportunities, and applications usually require a CV.

## Early Milestones in Each Department
There's a lot of variability in the department graduation requirements. Here's a short summary of some of the milestones that occur up to the qualifying exam and what is required for each milestone for the departments that are commonly represented in the Lippmann Lab. Graduate school documents for forming your thesis committee, scheduling your qualifying exam, and preparing your dissertation/defense can be found [here](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/academics/forms_timeline.php). Make sure you are aware of your department's specific requirements for each milestone. 

### Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CHBE) {#chbe}
- **Departmental Exam:** This exam typically occurs in late August/early September. Students are expected to prepare a 10 page written report and a 20 minute oral presentation. Students should focus on how the principles of chemical engineering applies to their research and should demonstrate the progress they have made on their research projects. One retake is held in December if students do no pass the first exam. 

- **Qualifying Exam:** Chemical Engineering students are expected to take their qualifying exam by the end of their 5th semester at Vanderbilt (although most students take it sometime during their 2nd year). Students should prepare a written document and an oral presentation on their dissertation proposal. Written documents should be given to the students' committees at least 2 weeks before the oral component of the exam. This exam can be taken a maximum of 2 times. 

  - **Thesis Committee:** A minimum of 4 people including Ethan, 2 CHBE faculty members, and an additional faculty member from outside the department. Students should meet with their committee at least once a year after passing their qualifying exam. 

### Biomedical Engineering (BME) {#bme}
- **Mentoring Committee Meetings:** Prior to forming our thesis committee, BME graduate students are randomly assigned a committee of 3 BME professors (including Ethan) around November of their first year. BME students are expected to meet with their mentoring committee every 6 months until they form their thesis committee. These meetings are typically just 30 minutes with 15 minutes spent presenting to your committee and 15 minutes for questions. The template for mentoring committee meeting presentations can be found [here]().

- **Qualifying Exam:** Lippmann lab Biomedical Engineering students typically take their qualifying exam during their 3rd year at Vanderbilt (although there is some flexibility). Students should prepare a written document and an oral presentation on their dissertation proposal. Written documents should be given to the students' committees at least 2 weeks before the oral component of the exam.

  - **Thesis Committee:** A minimum of 5 people including Ethan, 2 BME faculty (with at least one having a primary appointment in BME), at least one member from VUMC, and an additional member from any department. BME students are expected to meet with their committee at least every 6 months after passing their qualifying exam.

## Advice on Scheduling Committee Meetings
It can be notoriously difficult to schedule meetings with committee members due to faculty members' busy schedules. We recommend choosing a 2 week period of time and confirming that Ethan will be available those weeks. You can also ask your committee members if there are days that are generally not good for them to meet (ex: their lab meeting schedules or days they teach). Once you have a shortened list of potential days and times, you can create a Doodle poll to determine what will work for all your committee members. Note that if you have a VUMC faculty member on your committee, they may have secretaries that you can email for quicker responses. 

## CZI Resources
The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN) provides resources for Lippmann lab trainees. They hold an annual conference where Ethan can take 2 trainees; he will discuss how trainees will be selected for this conference before it starts. They also hold a weekly seminar series. The schedule for this seminar will be sent out in the monthly newsletter. All seminar presentations are recorded in the [NDCN forum](https://ndcn-forum.cziscience.com/). Additionally, there is a Slack workspace that staff, graduate students, and postdocs can access. There are weekly Computational Office Hours where trainees can learn to a variety of computational topics including processing RNAseq data and creating reproducible code. There is also a staff and trainee database being developed for further collaborations and networking. Talk to Ethan or senior lab members if you are interested in getting more involved with the opportunities provided by CZI.
