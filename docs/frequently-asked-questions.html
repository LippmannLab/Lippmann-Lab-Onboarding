<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Scheduling Vacations</h2>
<p>Taking time off is necessary to avoid burn-out during graduate school. While iPSC culture requires daily maintenance, it is still possible to take vacations and rest. Short trips over the weekend do not need to be cleared with me, but I should be aware if you are planning on taking longer periods of time off. I have yet to tell any lab members that they could not take a vacation, but you need to be smart about when you plan to be away so that progress is not disrupted.</p>
<p>If you are asking another lab member to cover your work while you are out of lab, you should ask that lab member at least a week before you are gone (unless it’s a personal health or family emergency). Before you leave you should provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How long you’ll be out of lab</p></li>
<li><p>What cells need their media changed each day you are gone and what media to use following this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e7WmtnTOwzWEQ0M4DY7jF22D8st5nZTYDcJ1Tv7Nfsg/edit?usp=sharing">template</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the cells are located</p></li>
<li><p>Where media and other necessary reagents are located</p></li>
<li><p>How to make more media if the lab mate is not used to maintaining the cell types</p></li>
<li><p>How to operate devices (if needed)</p></li>
<li><p>If you want more iPSCs when you come back and if you are leaving Matrigel plates</p></li>

<li><p>Ask your lab mate to run crucial experiments for you while you are gone</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain short term differentations (ex: BMECs) or common iPSCs (ex: CC3s) if you’ll be gone for a week or more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, first year students will take Thanksgiving break off. More senior students will rotate who covers this holiday. The lab generally shuts down for the holidays in December/January, although a couple of lab members may stay behind for maintaining long-term cultures (like neurons or organoids) or animals. Holidays such as the 4th of July or Labor Day are usually treated as half days where many people usually choose to do their bare minimum work and take the rest of the day off. If lab meetings fall on the U.S. Election Day, Ethan will cancel those meetings in order to allow lab members to vote if they have not already.</p>
<p>Overall, it is up to you to make sure that you are getting the necessary work done in order to graduate on time.</p>

<div id="mental-health-in-graduate-school" class="section level2" number="8.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Mental Health in Graduate School</h2>
<p>Mental health is a major issue in graduate school. Many members of the lab use mental health resources available on campus including the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/">University Counseling Center (UCC)</a> and the <a href="https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/current_students/gradlife.php">Vanderbilt Graduate Life Coach</a>. Our medical insurances provides free access to <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/services/psychiatric-services/">psychiatry services</a> although medication may still cost some money. There are also outside resources such as <a href="https://www.phdbalance.com/">PhD Balance</a>. Feel free to reach out to other members of the lab if you are having issues or need people to talk to! Several students over the years have been up front with me about their mental health struggles and I have made efforts to accommodate their needs, but I can only help if I know there is a problem. I fully acknowledge that I sometimes ask students to do too much, so if you are struggling or overly stressed because of lab work, it needs to be discussed so we can come to a mutual decision on acceptable outputs.</p>

<div id="advice-on-navigating-co-mentorships" class="section level2" number="8.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Advice on Navigating Co-Mentorships</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>No matter whether Ethan is your primary or secondary adviser, you are welcome to use the Lippmann lab spaces and equipment (some equipment such as the biosafety hoods, microscope, and osmometer needs extra training). You are also invited and encouraged to attend Lippmann lab social events.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, your co-advisor will be a faculty member that Ethan already has a working relationship with (a close collaborator or someone on a shared grant)</p></li>
<li><p>Time spent in the labs of both mentors is rarely split evenly, so make sure it is clear to everyone who will serve as your “primary” mentor, why this choice was made, and the relative time that you will be spending in each lab.</p></li>
<li><p>At the beginning of your co-mentorship, make sure to have a meeting where all three of you discuss the general outline of your research direction. While this may be difficult to do during your first semester, make sure that you are actively communicating with Ethan and your other advisor about where your project is at and any research changes. You are responsible for communicating between your advisors and making sure that they are on the same page with the status of your research. Co-mentorship is meant to enhance the scope of research but it can get messy if communication breaks down.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, if you’re feeling overburdened with double lab meetings, journal clubs, etc, then talk with Ethan about it! The goal of a co-advising relationship is for you to have the freedom to develop a more interdisciplinary project by pulling on the expertise of Ethan and your co-advisor. While it might require more time-juggling on the front end (learning two lab cultures, attending double lab meetings, doing more background reading to get acquainted), make sure that you’re also not neglecting your research! Communicate, communicate, communicate. It will always help you to be clear with Ethan about your stress level/workload and you can find a solution by having open conversations about it.</p></li>

<div id="chbe" class="section level3" number="8.10.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.1</span> Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CHBE)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Departmental Exam:</strong> This exam typically occurs in late August/early September. Students are expected to prepare a 10 page written report and a 20 minute oral presentation. Students should focus on how the principles of chemical engineering applies to their research and should demonstrate the progress they have made on their research projects – the latter point is the most important, while the former point will typically be raised by the faculty during the Q&amp;A. One retake is held in December if students do not pass the first exam.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualifying Exam:</strong> Chemical Engineering students are expected to take their qualifying exam by the end of their 5th semester at Vanderbilt (although most students take it sometime during their 2nd year). Students should prepare a written document and an oral presentation on their dissertation proposal. Written documents should be given to the students’ committees at least 2 weeks before the oral component of the exam. This exam can be taken a maximum of 2 times.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Committee:</strong> A minimum of 4 people including Ethan, 2 CHBE faculty members, and an additional faculty member from outside the department. Students should meet with their committee at least once a year after passing their qualifying exam.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.2</span> Biomedical Engineering (BME)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mentoring Committee Meetings:</strong> Prior to forming our thesis committee, BME graduate students are randomly assigned a committee of 3 BME professors (including Ethan) around November of their first year. BME students are expected to meet with their mentoring committee every 6 months until they form their thesis committee. These meetings are typically just 30 minutes with 15 minutes spent presenting to your committee and 15 minutes for questions. The template for mentoring committee meeting presentations can be found <a href="">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualifying Exam:</strong> Lippmann lab BME students typically take their qualifying exam during their 3rd year at Vanderbilt (although there is some flexibility). Students should prepare a written document and an oral presentation on their dissertation proposal. Written documents should be given to the students’ committees at least 2 weeks before the oral component of the exam.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Committee:</strong> A minimum of 5 people including Ethan, 2 BME faculty (with at least one having a primary appointment in BME), at least one member from VUMC, and an additional member from any department. BME students are expected to meet with their committee at least every 6 months after passing their qualifying exam.</li>

<div id="ims" class="section level3" number="8.10.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.3</span> Interdisciplinary Materials Science Program (IMS)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Preliminary Exam:</strong> This exam will be taken before the end of the third semester at Vanderbilt, ideally after the majority of required coursework is completed. The main purpose of this exam is to confirm that you have the potential to make a successful PhD student and that you have an adequate understanding of the foundations of materials science from all previous courses. Since our lab is mostly concerned with biomaterials, this exam will be focused on a short presentation of all the research you have accomplished (10-15 min) and an “area paper” (4-10p) which will need to be submitted to your committee at least one week before your exam. You will be responsible for forming a preliminary exam committee which consists of five faculty members (including Ethan) that are from at least three different departments. This may be the same committee that you choose to move forward with for your qualifying exam, but it does not have to be. If you fail your first examination, your committee may decide to allow you to sit for a second exam or suggest that you complete the additional research work required to earn a master’s degree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualifying Exam:</strong> The IMS qualifying same is similar to quals for other departments. Its main purpose is to determine that your proposed research will be worthy of attaining your PhD. It must be completed within four years of entering Vanderbilt and at least six months before defending. Similar to the Preliminary Exam, there is both a written and oral portion although each are more lengthy. The written proposal should be sent to your committee at least two weeks before your exam and is a formal, detailed justification of your proposed hypothesis future research direction, supported by the work that you have completed so far. You will then give a 30-minute talk to your committee, followed by a period of oral examination.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Committee:</strong> The composition of your thesis committee for your qualifying exam and PhD defense may be the same as for your preliminary exam. Your thesis committee should comprise of your 2 thesis advisers and 3 other faculty members. Three faculty must be members of the Graduate Faculty and at least 3 affiliated with the Materials Program. For more detailed information see “Expectations for IMS preliminary and qualifying exams” document that you received during orientation.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.4</span> Interdisciplinary Graduate Program (IGP) and Quantitative and Chemical Biology (QCB): Neuroscience Track</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Qualifying Exam:</strong> All neuroscience students take their qualifying exams at the end of the second year. The requirements typically include a written exam in the form of a Nature Neuroscience style review document. This review is expected to cover literature that supports the student’s disseration research topic and must be broadly related to their thesis. Alongside the review document, the student is expected to submit a specific aims page outlining their plan for the next few years of grad school (work on this begins as part of a grant writing course in the Spring). Neither documents can be reviewed by the PI and must be original work. Following submission of the written portion of the exam, students take an oral qualifier comprised of a 5 minute chalk talk followed by open question by the committee for up to 2 hours. This includes topics like general knowledge of neuroscience, experimental design and thesis project. Oral exams usually occur between June to August. The qualifying exam committee must comprise of three professors of the student’s choice and one department appointed committee chair.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Committee:</strong> The composition of the thesis committee may differ from that of the qualifying exam committee. These are typically professors with research backgrounds similar to the student’s thesis project. You are required to have 2 Neuroscience faculty members and 1 external faculty member on your committee. Committee meetings should typically occur atleast once a year until the final defense or more frequently as requested by the student or committee.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.11</span> Advice on Scheduling Committee Meetings</h2>
<p>It can be notoriously difficult to schedule meetings with committee members due to faculty members’ busy schedules. We recommend choosing a 2 week period of time and confirming that Ethan will be available those weeks. You can also ask your committee members if there are days that are generally not good for them to meet (ex: their lab meeting schedules or days they teach). Once you have a shortened list of potential days and times, you can create a Doodle poll to determine what will work for all your committee members. Note that if you have a VUMC faculty member on your committee, they may have secretaries that you can email for quicker responses.</p>

He will contact you if there is an opportunity to mentor a high school student. Typically, these students will shadow you while you conduct your research and submit an article to the <a href="https://www.youngscientistjournal.org/">Vanderbilt Young Scientist Journal</a>. This is can range for a couple months to a couple years commitment. In addition to research, some students may also ask you questions about college and the application process. Occasionally, other high school students will spend a day shadowing you in lab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergraduate Graduate Students:</strong> There are many opportunities to mentor undergraduate students whether they are Vanderbilt students or visiting summer students. Talk to Ethan if you are interested in mentoring an undergrad or could use help with your projects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Younger Graduate Students:</strong> Senior graduate students are expected to help mentor and train younger graduate students. Typically, students sharing common research interests will be paired together, but all senior students can help younger students adjust to graduate school.
