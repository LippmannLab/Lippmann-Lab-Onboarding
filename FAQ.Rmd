# Frequently Asked Questions
These are topics that are commonly asked about when new members join the lab. Additionally, feel free to ask senior lab members for more information or advice whenever you have questions. 

## Scheduling Vacations
Taking time off is necessary to avoid burn-out during graduate school. While iPSC culture requires daily maintenance, it is still possible to take vacations and rest. Short trips over the weekend do not need to be cleared with Ethan, but Ethan should be aware if you are planning on taking longer periods of time off. 

If you are asking another lab member to cover your work while you are out of lab, you should ask that lab member at least a week before you are gone (unless it's a personal health or family emergency). Before you leave you should provide the following information:

- How long you'll be out of lab

- What cells need their media changed each day you are gone and what media to use following this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e7WmtnTOwzWEQ0M4DY7jF22D8st5nZTYDcJ1Tv7Nfsg/edit?usp=sharing). 

- Where the cells are located

- Where media and other necessary reagents are located

- How to make more media if the lab mate is not used to maintaining the cell types

- How to operate devices (if needed)

- If you want more iPSCs when you come back and if you are leaving Matrigel plates

You should not:

- Ask your lab mate to run experiments for you while you are gone

- Maintain short term differentations (ex: BMECs) or common iPSCs (ex: CC3s) if you'll be gone for a week or more 

Typically, first year students will get Thanksgiving break off. More senior students will rotate who covers this holiday. The lab generally shuts down for the holidays in December/January, although a couple of lab members may stay behind for maintaining long-term cultures (like neurons or organoids) or animals. Holidays such as the 4th of July or Labor Day are usually treated as half days where many people usually choose to do their bare minimum work and take the rest of the day off. If lab meetings fall on the U.S. Election Day, Ethan will cancel those meetings in order to allow lab members to vote if they have not already.

It is up to you to make sure that you are getting the necessary work done in order to graduate on time. 

## Mental Health in Graduate School

## Registering for Courses in the YES Portal
Graduate students register for courses on the [Vanderbilt YES Portal](http://yes.vanderbilt.edu/). You can register for courses using the "Student Registration" tab. All graduate students are required to enroll in 9 credit hours every semester. 

- Enrolling in Classes: 
  - Search for the courses you are required to take/interested in taking
  - Click on the course and click the "Add to Cart" button at the bottom of the pop up screen. 
  - Move the to "In Cart" tab. 
  - Click the down arrow at the left side of the course. Click on "Enroll."
  - You can see how many courses/credit hours you are enrolled in for each semester by moving to the "Enrolled" tab. 

- Enrolling in Research Credit:
  - Search your home department in the search bar. 
  - If you have not passed your qualifying exam yet, select Ethan's course in the Non-Candidate Research offerings. If you have passed your qualifying exam, select Ethan's course in the Ph.D. Dissertation Research offerings. 
  - Enroll in the course using the instructions listed in the "Enrolling in Classes" bullet point. 
  - Move to the "Enrolled" tab. On the right side of the course, there is an edit button (looks like a pencil and paper). Click the edit button. 
  - Select the number of research credit hours you need to enroll in, and click the "Save" button. 
  - This needs to be done every semester even after you are done taking classes for Vanderbilt tuition purposes (Ph.D. students do not pay for tuition themselves). 

## Recommended Elective Courses
Graduate students are expected to take courses that are required by their specific department. Some training grants such as the T32 in Environmental Toxicology also have course requirements that appointees must take. The number of elective classes you can take varies by department, but here's a list of common elective courses that Lippmann Lab graduate students take to finish their course requirements:

- NURO 8345: Fundamentals of Neuroscience I (offered every Spring)

- NURO 8365: Neurobiology of Disease (offered every Spring)

- CHBE 5890: Special Topics - Biomolecular Engineering and Design (Ethan's elective course that is offered every other Spring)

- BME 8901: Special Topics - Mol,Cellular,&TissueMechanobio (offered every Fall)

- BME 7410: Quantitive Methods in Biomedical Engineering (offered every Fall)

- CHBE 5820: Immunoengineering (offered every Spring)

- BME 8901: Computational Genomics (offering variable)

BME students can take 1 Chemical Engineering Course as as BME Course requirement with no questions asked. Additional courses must be cleared by [Dr. Reinhart-King](mailto:cynthia.reinhart-king@VANDERBILT.EDU).

## Early Milestones in Each Department
There's a lot of variability in the department graduation requirements. Here's a short summary of some of the milestones that occur up to the qualifying exam and what is required for each milestone for the departments that are commonly represented in the Lippmann Lab. Graduate school documents for forming your thesis committee, scheduling your qualifying exam, and preparing your dissertation/defense can be found [here](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/academics/forms_timeline.php). Make sure you are aware of your department's specific requirements for each milestone. 

### Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CHBE) {#chbe}
- **Departmental Exam:** 

- **Qualifying Exam:** 

### Biomedical Engineering (BME) {#bme}
- **Mentoring Committee Meetings:** Prior to forming our thesis committee, BME graduate students are randomly assigned a committee of 3 BME professors (including Ethan) around November of their first year. BME students are expected to meet with their mentoring committee every 6 months until they form their thesis committee. These meetings are typically just 30 minutes with 15 minutes spent presenting to your committee and 15 minutes for questions. The template for mentoring committee meeting presentations can be found [here]().
