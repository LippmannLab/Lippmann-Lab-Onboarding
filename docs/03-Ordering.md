## Ordering Training

### Departmental Shopper
Departmental shoppers are able to create requisitions in Oracle, but are not able to submit their requisitions for processing. They must reassign their requisitions to a Procurement Requester for the order to be placed. Every lab member should become at least a Departmental Shopper. 

1. Access the Introduction to Oracle Cloud Procurement training module in Oracle using the steps listed in the [Training Chapter](#training). 

2. Open the "Me" section in Oracle. 

3. Click the "Roles and Delegations" button. 

4. Click the "Add" button to request the role of VU_Departmental Shopper. Click "Save" to confirm. 

5. Make sure that VU_Departmental Shopper is included in your Role Requests Section. This role should become active within a business day.

## How to place orders
Commonly purchased items are listed in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13m76wa6D7RpNgtVolgLW7oUlB0JmVAlQNCRtXGdosbc/edit?usp=sharing). This [Purchasing Folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MHIqY_gJsaVwZvy92M90tAaFEfcg_pQw/view?usp=sharing) also stores additional useful ordering information. 

### Prior to Creating a Requisition in Oracle 
1. Download and fill out the [Purchase Request Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sv-9x9ky6_tleJ2rFb5CJseFnJjDlw88/view?usp=sharing).
    - Required information includes: Vendor, Justification, POET Numbers, Item Quantity, Unit, Model/Catalog #, Description, Unit Cost, and Total Cost , Quote Number (if applicable). 
    - If splitting order among many grants, list this information in the in the COA/POET number(s) section. 
    - Justification should include information about what you are purchasing and how it will be used for the grant you are charging it to. 
    - General lab items can have a justification such as "[Item] will be used for general lab procedures/cell culture for [grant name]."
      - Amazon orders must also include this statement : "These items could not be found with these specifications or this price from any other vendor."
    - Save a copy of this file for your records. The recommended naming format is "Lippmann lab purchase request form - YearMonthDay - Vendor.xlsx." Make sure to save your quotes too for future reference. 
    
    - One purchase request form should be filled out for each vendor you are purchasing from. 

2. Send the PO request forms (and quotes if applicable) to Ethan for approval. Make any edits that he lists and resend for final approval. Save his approval emails for later. 

3. Once you have Ethan's approval, you can proceed to creating a requisition in Oracle by selecting the "Purchase Requisitions" button in the Procurement tab. 

### Catalog Orders
Catalog orders refer to any vendor that can be found on the Acquire catalog. These vendors include Abcam, Cell Signaling Technology, Fisher, Guy Brown, McMaster, Sigma, and VWR. 

1. Click on the down button next to "Shop by Category" and select "Acquire."

2. Select the vendor you are ordering from. 
    - Make sure that the vendor is linked to your Oracle Cloud account before proceeding. The page usually lists your email or notes the Vanderbilt Purchasing Department on the home page. 
    - If you are not linked, simply return to the Acquire catalog page and reselect the vendor. 
  
3. Add the items you have been approved to purchase. 

4. Go to your cart and checkout. This should return you to the Acquire Catalog.

5. Click the "Check Out" button on the Acquire Catalog page, which will create the beginning of your requisition.

6. For the "Description" section, include this information at the minimum: Your Last Name - Lippmann - Vendor. You can also include information about what you are ordering in this requisition if you want. 

7. Copy and paste your justification from your purchase request form to the "Justification" section. 

8. Under attachments, include a copy of Ethan's approval. Make sure the Category is set to "Approver." Click "OK" to save. See the ["Information to Include When Reassigning to a Procurement Requester"](#reassign) section for additional attachments to include if you are a Departmental Shopper. 

9. Make sure your "Deliver-to Location" is set to Olin Hall 107. 

    - The exception is AL Gas Orders. 
    
    - You can make this your default by ***fill in***. 
    
10. Each item needs to have the Billing information filled out. You can edit multiple items by selecting all the items that go on the same grant, clicking the down arrow by "Actions," and selecting "Edit."

    - Under "Project Number," put the grant number before the period (ex: 601413 for CZI). 
    
    - Under "Task Number," put the grant number after the period (ex: 1 for CZI or 10 for Start-Up). 
    
    - The "Expenditure Type" should be "SuppLab" for almost every requisition you make. 
    
    - The "Expenditure Organization" is 15220 - Chemical Engineering. This is true for all requisitions you make no matter what your home department is since Ethan's primary appointment is in the Chemical Engineering Department. 
    
    - You should fill out the "Charge Account" with the following information. You can edit this section by clicking the button directly to the right of the text box. 
      - Entity: 150 - School of Engineering
      
      - NetAssetClass: 15 - Sponsored Contract and Grants (except Start Up which is 10 - Unrestricted Faculty and Student Organization Funds)
      
      - FinancialUnit: 15220 - Chemical Engineering
      
      - Account: 6105 - Supplies Expense - Lab
      
      - All other section should be kept at the default (000 or 0). These are just potential future labeling numbers that are not currently in use. 
      
      -Click "OK" when done filling out. 
      
    - "Budget Date" should be the date you are submitting the requisition. 

    - If adding multiple items to the same billing information, put 100% in the "Percentage" section. If splitting the same item across multiple grants, send to a Purchase Requester to fill out as this can get slightly complicated. 

11. You can save your requisition by hitting the "Save" button. It is recommended that you do this often. If you want to save the requisition to work on later, you can click the down arrow next to "Save" and click on "Save and Close."

12. If you are a Purchase Requester, you can hit the "Submit" button when you are done editing a requisition. If you are a Departmental Shopper, you can reassign your requisition to a Purchase Requester by ***fill in***.
