It should be kept as up-to-date as possible. The lab has a Slack, which we use more quick messaging. Request to be added to our lab’s listserv by emailing Alex Sorets. This is generally used for longer, lab-wide announcements. Our lab also has 3 calendars to schedule general lab events, book specific hoods, and to book time on our microscope. Request access to these calendars: Lippmann Lab Calendar, Lippmann Lab Microscope, Lippmann Lab 118 Small Hood. Send an email to the Vanderbilt IT Department asking for access to our lab’s shared network drive. Include your VU NetID in this email. Finally, our lab has a Github that we use for code versioning and internal sharing. 1.2 Becoming an effective researcher There is no set formula to facilitate a productive research career but based on Dr. Lippmann’s experiences and the graduate students he’s seen crash and burn, he expects that you will: Spend 40-60 hours a week in the lab environment. Do your work when it needs to be done. Preparation, preparation, preparation Be honest with your data - to Dr. Lippmann and yourself. Read, read, read. Stay current on the literature. Keep a personal library of the papers you read. Keep your lab notebook up-to-date. Attend campus seminars that are relevant to your research, and probably a few that you simply find interesting. Rely on the experience of others. If you want to build something: 1.3 Fellowships All lab members are expected to apply for external funding. For graduate students, this includes the NSF GRFP, NDSEG, NIH F31 fellowship, and AHA pre-doctoral fellowships. Dr. Lippmann can discuss other opportunities that arise, and he will be cognizant that certain students are not competitive for certain fellowships, but every student-earned fellowship provides more money that can be spent on supplies and equipment. Current and previous students have uploaded their applications to Google Drive for internal sharing.
