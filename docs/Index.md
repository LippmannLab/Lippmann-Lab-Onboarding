# Preface {-}

The purpose of this document is to outline what the Lippmann lab expects from incoming graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in terms of organization, work ethic, and accountability, as well as to help new lab members get integrated as quickly as possible. Some parts of this document are written in the first person (Ethan's perspective), but many lab members contributed to this document and their voices are heard throughout. We are particularly grateful to Kylie Balotin, who wrote the initial source code to make this document accessible and editable online.


*We acknowledge that the land that Vanderbilt University lies on is the ancestral land of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Shawnee, and other Native peoples who were forcefully removed to Oklahoma in the Indian Removal Act of 1830. We honor the elders past and present for the stewardship of this land.*
